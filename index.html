                <h2>Memories</h2>
                <p>We met on August 2019 , i didn't remember the exact date. I recognised his ability that he is good in studies when
                    I.S. Sir , our physics teacher came in and asked the class about who is Abhay and Zaid??. We were suprised , later we came to know that
                    we got highest marks in physics.We lived in the same hostel , his room is just beside mine. I usually comes to him having some doubt
                    in subjects. He was found of books and still he is. He always comes to my rescue whenever i'm stuck at some subject.We were both intrested in 
                    watching anime. Our favorite anime till date is <strong>"Naruto: Shippuden"</strong> and we used to watch his episode together while having the dinner on my laptop.I'm still
                    missing those Golden Days.

                <h2>Character Sketch:-</h2>
                <p><strong>As you Know Naruto is one of ours favorite   anime and it's such a drag to find which character does Abhay resamble to.<br>
                    But  i have given it a try:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shikamru <p> His smartness and way he solves a problem reminds me of Shikamru</p></li>
                        <li>Metal <p>
                            As the name suggest he is not afraid when he is right with respect to subject knowledge, but he 
                            nervous while speaking in crowd or in front of teachers.He sometime remind me of metal (A character in boruto who starts to act
                            weird when crowd watches him) .But i'm sure he will soon be able to cope up with these stuffs.
                        </p></li>
                        <li>Lee <p> As he is as hard-working as Lee</p></li>
                        <li>Naruto <p>He have big heart and he never goes back on his words . Although he is not after sakura or any other girl nor he uses sexy jutsu 
                            but he train himself hard to learn new things and always give his 100% in making task worth it.
                        </p></li>
                        <li>Sasuke <p>As sasuke is a bit introvert , like wise abhay stays out from girls. And like sasuke Abhay is over something
                            .Means that like saske fixes his goal and shows full dedication towards it , same does Abhay do. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Master Jiyraya <p>The Bound between Master Jiyraya and Naruto aligns with my relationship with Abhay.
                            He always there to teach me new things . Also , he is always there to help me out whenever i'm stuck.
                        </p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Although , our bond is like the friendship of Naruto & Sasuke.
